# 39 Ridiculous Box Shadows

Delicious, juicy CSS3.  

Ripe for the taking.

Oh, the glory.


## About
Inspired by [Doug Avery’s post](http://www.viget.com/uploads/file/boxshadows/), this 
handy little Stylus/CSS Library is just waiting for you to share the shadowy goodness 
on the Web.


## File Layout

 * Each box shadow is separated into its own file, so you can `@import` only the shadows you need.  
 * The `stylus` directory is the “true” source code.  It generates everything you see in `css` and `css-min`.
 * If you don’t use Stylus (you totally should, though), there’s pre-compiled CSS ready for you to use out of the box.  There’s even pre-*minified* CSS if you prefer.  Aren’t I thoughtful? :-) 
 * The filenames are silly, I know…  They’re named after the CSS class names of the original author.  I’d like to do something to improve the situation without completely losing the whimsy, though.  (Maybe symlinks…?)
